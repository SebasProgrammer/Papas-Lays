Introduction

This project aims to create a real-time lie detector using deep learning techniques. By analyzing micro-expressions and other facial cues, the model predicts the likelihood of deceit. The app is built with YOLOv9 for object detection and Streamlit for the web interface.

Features
Real-time detection: Stream video input and get instant lie detection results.
User-friendly interface: Easy to use, no deep learning expertise required.
Detailed analytics: Visual representation of detection probabilities.
Scalability: Can be deployed on various platforms, from local machines to cloud servers.
Installation
To get this project up and running locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lie-detector-app.git
cd lie-detector-app
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Usage
To use the app, simply run the above command and open your web browser to http://localhost:8501. From there, you can start streaming video and the model will process it in real-time to detect potential deceit.


Demo
Check out a live demo of the app here.


Technologies Used
